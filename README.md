### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

  - I felt prepared for the project through what we learnt in the labs. Specifically, using react props was instrumental in my project construction

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

  - I would save styling for the last step, it took up a lot of my initial process. While I improved on this since the previous week, I still have a lot of workflow alignment to do.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

  - My demo went really well, I was able to implement unique functionality such as the Youtube video background and adding favorites to the sidebar.
  - My peer consolidated their API requests into an external module, making it easier to call the functions in any other file. I will use this. I also go the idea to create a class which I can instantiate objects from for this functionality.
